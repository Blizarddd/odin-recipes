# odin-recipes
First coding project (the odin project)

The cuurent project is an application of THe Odin Projects assignment.
The assignment states that a website should be made using html to display dishes.
My website focuses necesarily on Egyptian dishes.
The project utilizes a home page and a page for each dish, links to switch pages, images, lists (ordered and unordered), paragraphs, headings, basic html syntax, and git stages, commits and pushes.
Thus i have learned to use those utilities and gained new skills.
