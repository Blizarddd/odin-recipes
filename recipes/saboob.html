    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Egyptian Saboob is a traditional flatbread that plays a central role in Egyptian cuisine. Made primarily from whole wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt, it has a soft texture and a slightly chewy crust. Saboob is typically baked in very hot ovens, often using a clay or stone surface, which gives it a slightly puffed appearance and a rustic flavor. It's commonly served with dishes like ful medames, falafel, and stews, and is essential for scooping up food in everyday Egyptian meals.</p>
